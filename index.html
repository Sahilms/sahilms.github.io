					<h1>  Make A DIFFERENCE </h1>
			
				<p> GOAL has worked on behalf of the poorest of the poor for 37 years. Since our foundation in 1977, we have spent in 						excess of â‚¬790 million in more than 50 developing countries, delivering aid to some of those most affected by 							humanitarian crises. During that time, natural and manmade disasters have wreaked enormous havoc and suffering amongst 					some of the poorest peoples in the world. In the aftermath of almost every famine, conflict, earthquake or a weather-					related catastrophe, GOAL has been there, delivering whatever relief we can.
					You can read about how we responded to some of these disasters below.</p>

				<p> Charitable giving is the act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate, either directly or by means of a charitable trust or other worthy cause. Charitable giving as a religious act or duty is referred to as almsgiving or alms. The name stems from the most obvious expression of the virtue of charity; giving the recipients of it the means they need to survive. </p>
